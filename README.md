## Hi there
As Ã‡oraman Lab. we are working on "Biological and genetic shaping mechanisms of Anatolia".
Under this title, we created the Biological Inventory of Anatolia.
We use the data we have in R, various libraries.
Using Various libraries in R we get taxonomy of species, IUCN status and occurrence data.
